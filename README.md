# Tech Degree Project 1
 My first Tech Degree Project

 Hello World?
 👋 Hi, I’m @florian-bam
- 👀 I’m interested in ... everything about email - that's why I'm learning how to code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... front-end web developement
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... responsive email templates
- 📫 How to reach me ... I don't quite know. If you really want to reach out, you'll find a way.


 To do:
 1. Fix semantic mark-up (add nav, fix header, etc.)
 2. Add a few more pages
 3. Add Github links
 4. Add some more content
 5. Maybe add some more images, or something?
 6. Add the "open new link" feature to all links

 Before submitting:
 1. Validate the HTML
 2. Validate the CSS
 3. Check image file sizes
 
 Happy Coding!
